# OpenScad Multiboard tile generator

## Setup

Due to licensing constraints, the Multiboard STL remix files are not included.  Please download the files from:

https://thangs.com/designer/Multiboard/3d-model/Tile%20Components%20-%20STL%20Multiboard%20Remixing%20Files-994663

and extract the zip file into the "remix-files" directory.


## Configure

Change the LAYOUT array in the script to suit your needs.  


## GUI

`python3 mb-tile-generator.py` from this working directory.


## Notes
Newer nightly releases of OpenScad are recommended for vastly improved rendering performance.  Tested with version 2025.09.16. 

Don't judge me on the Python code... It was largely an exercise in what Copilot could generate.  Lots of clean up could happen, but "it runs on my computer".  YMMV.
